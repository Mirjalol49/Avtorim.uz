# Modal System Implementation

## Overview

We've implemented a modern modal system to replace native JavaScript alert, confirm, and prompt calls. This system provides a consistent, themeable, and user-friendly interface for displaying notifications and prompts throughout the application.

## Components Created

1. **Modal Component** (`src/Components/Modal/Modal.jsx`): Reusable component that renders different types of modals:
   - Info/success modals for notifications
   - Error modals for error messages
   - Confirmation modals for user decisions

2. **Modal Context** (`src/context/ModalContext.jsx`): Context provider that manages modal state and provides hooks for components to trigger modals:
   - `useModal()` hook
   - `showInfoModal()`, `showSuccessModal()`, `showErrorModal()`, `showConfirmModal()` functions

3. **Modal Styling** (`src/Components/Modal/Modal.css`): CSS styling for the modals that includes:
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Animations for smooth transitions
   - Theme variable integration
   - Accessible styles for different modal types

## Integration Points

The modal system has been integrated into the following components:

1. **Shop Component** (`src/Ui/Shop/Shop.jsx`):
   - Replaced native `alert()` with `showSuccessModal()` when adding items to cart

2. **Cart Component** (`src/Ui/Shop/Cart.jsx`):
   - Replaced `window.confirm()` with `showConfirmModal()` for clearing cart and removing items

3. **Checkout Component** (`src/Ui/Shop/Checkout.jsx`):
   - Replaced success state and error alerts with modals
   - Integrated order success message with modal

4. **OrderForm Component** (`src/Ui/Shop/OrderForm.jsx`):
   - Replaced success screen and error alerts with modals
   - Enhanced user flow with confirmation callbacks

5. **Contact Component** (`src/Ui/Main/Contact/Contact.jsx`):
   - Replaced form submission alerts with modals

## Features

1. **Multiple Modal Types**:
   - Info/Success: Green styling with checkmark icon
   - Error: Red styling with warning icon
   - Confirm: Blue styling with question mark icon

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Focus trapping inside modal
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA attributes for screen readers

3. **Theming**:
   - Uses CSS variables for consistent styling
   - Dark/light mode compatible

4. **User Experience**:
   - Smooth animations
   - Backdrop click to dismiss
   - Escape key to close
   - Consistent button styling

## Usage Examples

```jsx
// Import the hook
import { useModal } from '../context/ModalContext';

// Inside a component
const YourComponent = () => {
  const { showSuccessModal, showErrorModal, showConfirmModal } = useModal();
  
  // Show a success message
  const handleSuccess = () => {
    showSuccessModal('Success!', 'Operation completed successfully');
  };
  
  // Show an error message
  const handleError = () => {
    showErrorModal('Error', 'Something went wrong');
  };
  
  // Show a confirmation dialog
  const handleDelete = () => {
    showConfirmModal(
      'Confirm Delete',
      'Are you sure you want to delete this item?',
      {
        onConfirm: () => {
          // Delete item logic
          console.log('Item deleted');
        },
        confirmText: 'Delete',
        cancelText: 'Cancel'
      }
    );
  };
  
  return (
    // Component JSX
  );
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent UI**: All notifications and prompts have the same look and feel
2. **Better UX**: More visually appealing than native browser dialogs
3. **Flexibility**: Easy to customize and extend
4. **Accessibility**: Improved accessibility compared to native dialogs
5. **Theming**: Works with the application's theme system
